# Urban Housing Market Cycles and Gentrification: An Agent-Based Model

## CITS4403 Computational Modelling Project

### Authors
- Ziqian Qin/Yao Qin (Student ID: 23934529/24144144)


## Project Overview
This project implements an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate and analyze urban housing market cycles and gentrification processes. We explore how individual decisions of homeowners, renters, investors, and businesses collectively shape urban neighborhoods and contribute to market fluctuations and demographic shifts.

## Key Features
- Simulation of multiple agent types: residents, investors, properties, and local businesses
- Dynamic property value evolution based on neighborhood characteristics
- Modeling of gentrification processes through resident mobility and neighborhood changes
- Analysis of income inequality and neighborhood diversity over time

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: mesa, numpy, matplotlib, pandas

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/PrescottClub/CITS4403_doubleQin.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:cd CITS4403_doubleQin

3. Install required libraries:pip install mesa numpy matplotlib pandas

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `CITS4403_doubleQin.ipynb`
2. Run the cells in order to execute the simulation and view the results
